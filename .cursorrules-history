Let's build a new Angular app starting from scratch.
Be sure to consult with the Angular documentation on how to do it "The Angular Way".
Use Angular CLI to generate the app, components, etc. (Do not use AnalogJS)
Let's take it step by step and work our way up to the final product.
When you give me a CLI command, wait for me to run it before continuing.
Requirements:

- Angular latest (currently 19.0.3) (do not install CLI globally, use npx equivalent for pnpm)
- strictly follows Angular Style Guide as defined on Angular.dev documentation
- the app should be called "dashboard"
- Tailwind + SCSS
- Vite
- pnpm for package manager
- ESLint
- Prettier, with printWidth set to 120
- Jest for unit testing
- Playwrite for E2E testing

The app will be a mock app to showcase the latest features of Angular.
To accomplish this, let's build a fake dashboard with a sidebar and a main content area.
It should be a dark theme only (no light theme).
It should be responsive from medium breakpoint onwards.
The sidebar menu should have about 5 items, which will change the main content area.
Pick the 5 menu items yourself, as representative of a standard dashboard.

These are some of the Angular features we want to showcase. Be sure to write them in the newest, most modern way possible:

- Standalone Components
- Directive Composition
- Signals and Linked Signals
- Declarative Control Flow Syntax (@if, @for, @switch, etc)
- Typed Forms
- Deferred Rendering with @defer and @placeholder
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Incremental Hydration for SSR
- Route-Level Render Modes (server, client, prerender)

And these are some general programming concepts we want to showcase:

- Transclusion / Content Projection / Compound Components
- Eloquent Composition
- Declarative Programming
- Functional Programming
- Design Patterns
