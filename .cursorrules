Go through the entire codebase once and assess where we stand with the original requirements. Make a list of missing features / bugs.

For reference, here are the original requirements:

These are some of the Angular features we want to showcase. Be sure to write them in the newest, most modern way possible:

- Standalone Components
- Directive Composition
- Signals and Linked Signals
- Declarative Control Flow Syntax (@if, @for, @switch, etc)
- Typed Forms
- Deferred Rendering with @defer and @placeholder
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Incremental Hydration for SSR
- Route-Level Render Modes (server, client, prerender)

And these are some general programming concepts we want to showcase:

- Transclusion / Content Projection / Compound Components
- Eloquent Composition
- Declarative Programming
- Functional Programming
- Design Patterns
